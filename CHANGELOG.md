# Changelog

## 2.0.0

  * [VSCP-framework repository](https://github.com/BlueAndi/vscp-framework) was restructured and the generic bootloader moved to this dedicated repository.
  * ```dataNum``` variable in the VSCP message (from VSCP-framework) was renamed to ```dataSize```. Therefore the source code was updated accordingly.
